## Summary

This project is a Node.js application that creates a RESTful API for movie and TV show data.  It scrapes data from multiple sources (uauFlix, Rede Canais, and IMDb), processes it, categorizes it by genre, and serves it via API endpoints (`/movie` and `/tv`). The application uses asynchronous operations, caching (file system), and unique identifier generation (UUIDs).  The project includes modules for web scraping, data processing, data merging, data storage (Save component), and data categorization.  Deprecated packages are flagged (request), and there are provisions for data updates and enrichment.  The code base could benefit from improvements to error handling, asynchronous loop management (`feed()` function), rate limiting, data validation, and testing.  The project currently uses a simple caching mechanism and could be enhanced using in-memory caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
